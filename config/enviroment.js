// Moving to the production enviroment where we will kept all the variables and crentials to a file name as enviroment.js in config folder.

// here we will define two modes for developement and as well as production

// usually credentials in developement mode are static and are only used in development mode.

// In production mode we use enviroment variables instead of static one so that not everyone can access it, but the one we want to. And they are dynamic that means random string.
